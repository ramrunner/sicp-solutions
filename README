	(((((((((((SICP SOLUTIONS BY dsp@2f30.org)))))))))))

some solutions are in their own files , others more extended exercises are packed together.
format is ex{Chapter}-{Number}|{Starting Number -- Ending Number}

most of them provide test__ functions that show the usage.

Extended exercises (like the picture language) are in their own directories.

cheers.
